Because of their specific properties, each type of wood has its typical uses.",

          "The material properties of the wood vary between different types of wood. Even within the same type of wood, the variations are large depending on the plant site, but also between different trees at one and the same plant site. However, even greater variation is found within one and the same tree, for example between different heights in the tree and between the marrow and the bark-near wood as well as between spring wood and summer wood in the individual annual ring. In addition, twigs and other fiber disorders, so-called features, affect the technical properties of the wood.",
